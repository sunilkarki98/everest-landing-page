      { q: "Do international students have to pay tax?", a: "Yes. If you stay in Australia for more than 6 months, you are generally considered an 'Australian resident for tax purposes'. This is good news, as it means you get the tax-free threshold (currently $18,200), meaning you pay 0% tax on the first $18,200 you earn." },
      { q: "Do I need a TFN or an ABN?", a: "If you are an employee (e.g., working in a restaurant or office), you only need a TFN. If you are an independent contractor (e.g., driving for Uber, freelance design, sub-contracting), you need both a TFN and an ABN." },
      { q: "What happens to my superannuation when I leave Australia?", a: "Employers must pay superannuation (retirement fund) on top of your wages. When your visa expires and you leave Australia permanently, we can help you claim this money back through a DASP application." }
