    longDescription: "Australia is experiencing a critical and growing shortage of skilled tradespeople across construction, automotive, electrical, and plumbing sectors. Trade qualifications (Certificate III and IV) are among the most affordable study options for international students and offer some of the fastest and most reliable pathways to Permanent Residency. Skilled tradespeople in Australia earn competitive salaries — often exceeding those of university graduates — with electricians, plumbers, and carpenters regularly earning over $80,000–$120,000 AUD per year. Trade courses are delivered through hands-on, workshop-based training at TAFEs and registered training organisations (RTOs), with mandatory industry placements that provide real Australian work experience. Many trade occupations appear on Australia's Priority Migration Skilled Occupation List, meaning graduates receive priority processing for skilled migration visas.",
